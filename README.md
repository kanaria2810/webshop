# Project
A simple Webshop for buying watches
This Project is an assignment to module Webprogramming in my bachelor study.
Soo, keep it simple to the requirements
Of course it needs more development as well as cleaner architecture, so to say, 
but I think it will be useful for any students who want to have some references for their own projects.

About the structure, it uses PHP for backend and a MySQL database generated automatically by xampp
